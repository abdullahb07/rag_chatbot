# 🤖 Futuristic AI Chatbot (RAG-powered with LangChain)

A smart, contextual chatbot built using **LangChain**, **Streamlit**, and **FAISS**, enhanced with a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline. This chatbot answers questions based on a unique dataset of futuristic AI innovations projected between 2024 and 2030.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Uses a custom `.csv` dataset as its knowledge base
- 🔍 Retrieves context-aware chunks via semantic search
- 🤖 Generates natural language answers using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo
- 🖥️ Interactive chat interface powered by Streamlit
- ⚡ Fast retrieval with FAISS vector store

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The chatbot uses a curated dataset containing research-style descriptions of upcoming AI innovations across fields like:

- Healthcare (e.g., Neural Dust diagnostics)
- LegalTech (e.g., AI-driven judgment prediction)
- Space exploration (e.g., AI astronomers)
- Climate simulation
- Adaptive education
